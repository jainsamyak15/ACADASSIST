                            <h2>My Journey From Student to Creator</h2>
                            <p class="text-reveal">My YouTube journey started back in 2017 when I was still a student at Cambridge University. I was studying to become a doctor (the dream was to specialise in plastic surgery). Back then, I started creating videos to help other people with studying and passing exams. This is when I started my first business with my brother, 6Med. We created a platform to help people pass the entrance exams and get into medicine.</p>
                            <p class="text-reveal">Fast forward a few years and the videos I was creating started to be geared more towards productivity and passing on the knowledge that got me through medical school. I'd spend every spare minute I had planning the next video, writing scripts or researching ideas.</p>
                            <img src="images/1692806399655.jpeg" alt="Bhavya Jain Content Creation" class="img-fluid rounded" />

                            <p class="text-reveal">By 2020 I'd hired a small team to help me run the channel. With their help, I was bashing out a couple of videos a week whilst working as a junior doctor. That's when the idea of our Part Time YouTuber Academy came to me. I figured all the knowledge I'd gained on this journey would be helpful to at least 10 people, so we launched Cohort 1 of PTYA in November of 2020. Over 350 people joined lol.</p>
